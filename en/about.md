<h1> Approximation </h1>

Welcome to Approximation, a space for exploring infinite possibilities. The name “Approximation” is inspired by an important theorem in the field of machine learning—the <b>Universal Approximation Theorem</b>. This theorem states that for any continuous function $$f$$ and any given $$\epsilon > 0$$, there exists a feedforward neural network $$g$$ such that $$\| f - g \| < \epsilon$$. In other words, a simple neural network can approximate any complex function to any desired degree of accuracy.

Similarly, our brains are like vast neural networks, brimming with endless possibilities. According to the Universal Approximation Theorem, our brains can theoretically approximate any goal we wish to achieve, whether it be logical reasoning or artistic creation.

At Approximation, we explore the intersection of these infinite possibilities, sharing insights on the real-world applications of machine learning and mathematics, as well as presenting my artistic creations and photography. I hope you find inspiration here and join me in experiencing the blend of infinite wisdom and beauty.
