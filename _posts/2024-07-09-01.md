abstract: "<b>Abstract</b>: This project presents a machine learning approach to predict target features from a time-series dataset with minimal training data. The process is divided into three stages: parameter recognition, residual training, and final prediction adjustment. In the parameter recognition stage, a linear regression model is used to establish initial predictions. The residual training stage employs Bayesian Ridge Regression to refine these predictions by estimating residuals. The final prediction adjustment stage utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to further improve accuracy. This structured, parameter-focused learning approach significantly reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 0.0304 to 0.000473, demonstrating its effectiveness over a direct neural network application."
