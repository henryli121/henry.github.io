abstract: "<b>Abstract</b>: This research paper delves into the intricate algorithm of backpropagation in the
realm of machine learning, with a particular emphasis on its application in training
feedforward neural networks. The discourse extends to a meticulous proof of
the four fundamental equations of backpropagation and demonstrates its practical
implementation, in tandem with the stochastic gradient descent technique, for
recognizing handwritten digits."
