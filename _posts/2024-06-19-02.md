abstract: "<b>Abstract</b>: Pretrained transformers perform well in document classification with in-distribution data but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) instances. This project improves OOD detection in document classification by incorporating multi-modal information. Using LayoutLM for text-layout and combining LayoutLM with a ResNet-based feature extractor for image-layout-text, we show that integrating image information enhances OOD detection."
